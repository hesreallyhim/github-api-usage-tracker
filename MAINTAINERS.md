# Maintainers

This file documents the release workflow for this repository.

## Release automation (Release Please)

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
- Trigger: successful `CI` workflow run on `main` (or manual run via `workflow_dispatch`)
- Behavior: opens or updates a release PR and manages `CHANGELOG.md`
- Merge: merging the release PR creates the Git tag and GitHub Release

## Release checklist

1. Ensure commit messages follow conventional commits:
   - `fix:` for patch releases
   - `feat:` for minor releases
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` for major releases
2. Verify `dist/` is up to date if any `src/` files changed since the last release:
   - run `npm run bundle`
   - if `dist/` changes, commit them to the release PR
3. Confirm CI is green on the release PR
4. Merge the release PR

## After merge

- Confirm the GitHub Release is published (not a draft)
- Verify the Marketplace listing reflects the new release tag/version

## Notes

- `CHANGELOG.md` is generated by Release Please; avoid manual edits.
- If no release PR is created, confirm there are new conventional commits since the last tag.
